[This
abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s-bZM8kam85nFLLU4uAXUC2fgHxB81u75wtEFhqUVA/edit?usp=sharing)
shortly explains the context and the motivation of this project, and the current
results. [This poster](/Poster-SWR-NERF-retreat.pdf) that I made at the
beginning of the project visually shows the initial plan. I developed a
detection algorithm based on a gated recurrent neural network, yielding a
significant improvement over the state of the art method.
