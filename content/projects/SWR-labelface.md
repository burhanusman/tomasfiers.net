The signals I had to detect for my master's thesis where not clearly defined –
there is no ground truth available for them. I therefore made a [web
interface](https://tfiers.github.io/labelface) for the neuroscientists in the
lab

<!-- For my master's thesis, I had to detect "sharp wave-ripples", which is a well-known motif in electrophysiological recordings of the mammalian hippocampus, strongly linked to learning and memory. (Hippocampal neurons have been shown to – quite literally – replay past experiences during SWRs). -->
