[Byteflies](https://www.byteflies.com/) makes medical wearables â€“ small devices
full of sensors that can be worn anywhere on the body. My job was to validate
the signal quality of the motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and
magnetometer) against the golden standard: motion capture. Read all about it in
[this blog
