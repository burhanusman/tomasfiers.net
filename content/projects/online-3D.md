I wanted to learn about the gross neuroanatomy of the animals in the lab.
Learning brain anatomy from books is not very useful though. Inspired by the
great Allen Institute Brain Explorer for mice, I therefore made [this
interactive 3D visualisation](https://tfiers.github.io/3D-rat-brain/) of
structures in the rat brain, based on [open
data](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/whs-sd-atlas). The [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/tfiers/3D-rat-brain/blob/master/data/README.md)
explains how this data was processed. (Note: check out
[3dBAR](http://www.3dbar.org:8080/) for another 3D rat brain atlas, with more
features).
